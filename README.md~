Location aware applications are useful to provide many useful services to the user. Most
of the users are familiar about the location they live in. That is they know about what are the
best places to eat, what are best things to explore, which events are happening around and
how’s the current weather like. Using traditional search, user can search the above items of
interest about any particular new location using a separate search queries for each of them.
There is a need for the service which can gather the required data from different sources about
the particular location and combine the results in a single page using unified interface before
showing them to the user.
In project Locus, we are strongly focussing on location our users are interested in, hence
the name Locus (​ Loc​ ation foc​ us​ ). This is the mashup project in which we have solved data
integration query problem. Here the query from users is the location they are interested in and
the result is the relevant things of interest about that location. We are gathering data from
disparate sources using API endpoints provided by services from those sources. Data obtained
from the above disparate sources is consolidated and then returned as a query result to the
user on a single page using unified interface.
